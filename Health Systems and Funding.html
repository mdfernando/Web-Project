        <p>
            Immunization is one of the worldâ€™s most successful and cost-effective health 
            interventions. While vaccination coverage among infants increased from 72 per 
            cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015 before stalling until 2019, an estimated 
            19.7 million children did not receive essential vaccines during the first year 
            of their life in 2019. In addition, global coverage levels for the pneumococcal 
            conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence 
            of pneumonia, have yet to reach 50 per cent. Measles is a highly contagious 
            disease, and the 71 per cent coverage of the two-dose vaccine in 2019 was insufficient 
            to prevent outbreaks of measles.
