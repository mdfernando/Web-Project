            Immunization is one of the worldâ€™s most successful and cost-effective health 
            interventions. While vaccination coverage among infants increased from 72 per 
            cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015 before stalling until 2019, an estimated 
            19.7 million children did not receive essential vaccines during the first year 
            of their life in 2019. In addition, global coverage levels for the pneumococcal 
            conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence 
            of pneumonia, have yet to reach 50 per cent. Measles is a highly contagious 
            disease, and the 71 per cent coverage of the two-dose vaccine in 2019 was insufficient 
            to prevent outbreaks of measles.

            low income countries and territories made the most gains , owing primarly to infections
            illness measures. however ,growth has slowed since 2010, with the poorest countries and territories
            as well those hit by conflict , behind the most.

               reaching $ 11 biliion in 2019 , more than half of the money came from  the global Funding
               to flight AIDS, tuberculosis , and malaria , the gavi alliance  and the united states of america
               who contributed $ 3.4 billion was spent on basic health care $ 2.2 billion was spent on infectious

            The covid 19 pandemic response puts health workers on the front lines.
            countries and territories ,particularly those with a small health workforce,
            face addtional challenges in providing vital health services.
            The density of nursing and midwifery professionals in northern
            america is more than 150per 10 000 population ,which is more than 15 times
            that of sub-saharan africa and southern asia, according to data from
            2013 to 2018 .In northern America,oceania,and central asia 
            the density of medical professionals is roughly 25 per 10 000
            people,compared to 2 per 10 000 people in sub -saharan Africa.
