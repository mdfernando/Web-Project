            According to data from the period 2014-2020, 83 percent of births
            worldwide were assisted by skilled health professionals, an increase 
            from 71 percent in the period from 2007 to 2013. The  COVID-19 pandemic 
            may reverse gains in skilled childbirth care coverage and disrupt
            maternity health services.</h2></p>

            The world has made substantial progress towards the goal of ending preventable
             child deaths, with the global under-5 mortality rate decreasing from 76 to 38 
             deaths per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2019. The global neonatal mortality 
             rate fell from 30 deaths to 17 per 1,000 live births in the same period. Even with 
             such progress, 5.2 million children died in 2019 before reaching their fifth birthday, 
             with almost half of those deaths, 2.4 million, occurring in the first month of life. 
             While the full impact of the pandemic on child survival is not yet known, significant 
             disruption to the continued provision of life-saving interventions could stall or even 
             reverse the progress made.

            The proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49â€¯years) who have their family planning
            needs met by modern contraceptive methods has remained steady at around 77 per cent between
            2015 and 2021, reaching only 56 per cent in sub -Saharan Africa and 52 per cent in Oceania, 
            excluding Australia and New Zealand. The ongoing pandemic may lead to reductions in these 
            figures as a result of supply-chain disruptions and decreased access to family planning services,
            while the fertility intentions and family planning needs among women of reproductive age may also 
            change.

                The adolescent birth rate has fallen from 56 births per 1000 adolescent women 15 to 19 years of age
                in 2000 to 45 births per 1000 adolescents in 2015 and 41 per 1000 in 2020.<br/> The declines varied considerably
                across regions, with the largest decrease in central and<br/> Southern Asia from 70 births <br/> per 1000 adolescents
                in 2000 to 24 births per 1000 in 2020.
