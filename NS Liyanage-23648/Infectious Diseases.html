    <br> <b>38 millions </b> people globally were living with HIV in <strong>2019</strong> & newly infected number of people is <b>1.7</b> million with HIV. And 
    <b>25.4</b> million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy in that year also.<em>690 000</em> people died from HIV related illness in that year. That rate remained for higher 
    than the global target for <b>2020</b>.in <em>sub saharan africa</em> was the highest number of people living with HIV.

   In <b>2019</b>, an estimated <strong>10 million</strong> people fell ill with tuberculosis, of whom 56 per cent were adult men, 32 per cent adult women, 12 per cent children and 8.2 per cent people living with HIV, making it the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. Globally, the incidence of tuberculosis fell from 174 new and relapse cases per <b>100,000</b> population in 2000 to 130 cases per 100,000 in <b>2019</b>, a 25 per cent decline over the period, with the tuberculosis mortality rate among HIV-negative people falling by 45 per cent in the same period. Although the disease burden is decreasing, large gaps in detection and treatment persist, and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the target of ending tuberculosis by <b>2030</b>. Drug - resistant tuberculosis is a continuing threat: in <b>2019</b>, there were <em>465,000</em> new cases with resistance to rifampicin, the most effective first-line drug, and 78 per cent of those infected with tuberculosis had a multidrug-resistant strain. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated<b> 1.4 million</b> fewer people received necessary care for tuberculosis during 2020 compared with the previous year, a reduction in treatment levels of 21 per cent.

    Between <b>2015</b> and <b>2019</b>, the incidence of <em>malaria</em> plateaued at around 57 cases per <em>1,000</em> people at risk. The target of the World Health Organization for reductions in malaria case incidence in <b>2020</b> will be missed by 37 per cent. In <b>2019</b>, there were a total of <b>229 million</b> malaria cases worldwide, with the disease claiming some <em>409,000</em> lives. Gaps in funding and in access to life-saving tools are undermining global efforts to curb the disease, and the <b>COVID-19</b> pandemic is expected to set the fight back even further.

  <P>
    The use of the hepatitis B vaccine in infants has reduced the incidence of new chronic hepatitis B infections considerably. The proportion of children under 5 years of age who became chronically infected fell from 4.7 per cent in the pre-vaccination era to 0.9 per cent in <b>2020</b>. Worldwide, the <b>2020</b> target of 1 per cent seroprevalence in children under<b> 5 years</b> of age has been met. Additional efforts for increasing coverage are needed to achieve the Goal target of 0.1 per cent seroprevalence by <b>2030</b>.
    In <b>2019</b>, <b>1.74 billion</b> people were reported to have required mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from <b>2.19 billion</b> in<b> 2010</b> and <b>12 million</b> fewer than the figure reported for <b>2018</b>. The lower number of people requiring interventions is largely the result of having eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease in <b>42</b> countries and territories since <b>2010</b>.
