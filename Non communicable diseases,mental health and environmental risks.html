        <h1>Mental Health</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>What is mental health</h2>
        <p>
            Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. 
            It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life,
             from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.<br>

            Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior could be affected. 
            Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry</li>
            <li>Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse</li>
            <li>Family history of mental health problems</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Early Warning Signs</h2>
          <p>
             
            Not sure if you or someone you know is living with mental health problems? Experiencing one or more of the following feelings
               or behaviors can be an early warning sign of a problem:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much.</li>
                   <li>Pulling away from people and usual activities.</li>
                   <li>helplessness and hopelessness.</li>
                   <li>Fighting with family and friends.</li>
                   <li>Thinking of harming yourself and </li>
                   <li>Inability to perform everyday tasks.</li>
                   <li>Severe mood swings.</li>
                   <li>Hearing voices or believing things that are not true</li>
                   <li>Having low or no energy</li>
                   <li>Having unexplained aches and pains</li>
               </ul>

                  <h2>Responsibilities to ensure social sustainability</h2>
                      <p>The social sustainability of a treatment or service has a large influence on its availability or use. It is the responsibility of mental health organisations to address the elements underpinning social sustainability in order to ensure that treatments are evidence-based and relevant to community needs. This involves:
                          <ul>
                              <li>ensuring that treatments are evaluated on the basis of patient-reported outcomes</li>
                              <li>ensuring adequate recruitment, appropriate training and good support for staff working in mental health</li>
                              <li>publicly defending certain treatments that have a good evidence base but lack public support or, conversely, ensuring certain treatments that do have substantial public support are not provided carte blanche in the absence of evidence of patient benefit.</li>
                          </ul>
                          Greater awareness is needed about social sustainability to ensure that the use of evidence-based treatments continues into the future despite shifting patient, staff and public attitudes.

    <h1>Environmental Risks to Mental Health</h1> 
       <h2>How Environment Affects Mental Health</h2>
            <pre class="special"><q>Our environment is a combination of both physical factors such as where
you live and the people around you, both in your home but also on a wider
community scale,</q>says Rachelle Scott, MD, medical director of psychiatry
at Eden Health. </pre>
<br>
<br>
<p>Your mental health can be impacted by anything in your environment, but the most notable factors include: 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Aesthetics</b>: Cluttered spaces can create feelings of overwhelm and anxiety, while tidy spaces can invoke a sense of calm. To help with this,
             says to have colors and objects in your environment that are meaningful, which can boost mood. </li>
        <li><b>Sensory</b>: The lighting, temperature, sounds, smells, and color palette of an environment are very important to 
            how comfortable, relaxed, and safe you feel. For example, harsh lighting and loud noises can lead to anxiety or agitation, while dark and cold spaces can lead to feeling unmotivated—especially in the winter. </li>
        <li><b>People</b>: Indirect or inconsistent communication, conflicts, or unreliable people in the environment can be very stressful to manage. 
            However, sharing a space with someone you trust, 
            such as a partner or spouse, roommate or friend or loved one, can create a sense of calm. </li>
        <li><b>Culture and values</b>: It’s important for people to connect with others that share their culture and values and to be understood at a deeper level.
             Otherwise, feelings of isolation and depression can arise. </li>
    </ul></p>
    <br>
      
       <h2>Choosing Your Focus</h2>
          <p>No matter the type of environment you're in, make change by starting with the things you have control over and can accomplish relatively easily. 
For example, organize your space, change the lighting, or get a sound machine to cover up street noise.
To make the most impact, begin with the room you spend most of your time in and arrange it in a way that is functional and free of clutter.
According to Saltz, focusing on social surroundings, improving and growing more intimate in some relationships, being vulnerable with those you can 
trust to gain support and empathy while distancing yourself from truly toxic relationships that are negatively impacting mental health, can all make a substantial difference. </p>
       <h2>How Perception Impacts Mental Health</h2>
         <p>It’s easy to blame a toxic work environment, cluttered house, or rainy weather for your deteriorating mental health. But sometimes, your perception of the environment contributes just as much to how you feel.If you’re not in a position to change something about your environment, it’s critical that you work on reframing the beliefs you have about it. 
             <ul>
                 <li>Try to find appreciation in the environment,even if it is one positive thing can help reframe your thoughts about your environment.</li>
                 <li>Focus on what is working and supporting you in your current environment.</li>
                 <li>Do some small changes to make the environment more soothing and familiar, such as organizing, adding photos, or painting. </li>
                 <li>And finally, make sure to process any emotions or frustrations that are present through journaling, movement, or talking with a friend or therapist.</li>
             </ul>
