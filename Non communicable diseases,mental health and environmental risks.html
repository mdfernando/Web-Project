    <p>Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally.<br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each year, more than 15 million people die from a NCD between the ages of 30 and 69 years; 85% of these "premature" deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.</li>
            <li>77% of all NCD deaths are in low- and middle-income countries.</li>
            <li>Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, or 17.9 million people annually, followed by cancers (9.3 million), respiratory diseases (4.1 million), and diabetes (1.5 million).</li>
            <li>These four groups of diseases account for over 80% of all premature NCD deaths.</li>
            <li>Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets all increase the risk of dying from a NCD.</li>
            <li>Detection, screening and treatment of NCDs, as well as palliative care, are key components of the response to NCDs.</li>
