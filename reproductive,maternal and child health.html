        <h2><i>Reproductive, Maternal and Child Health</i></h2>
        <p><h3>According to data from the period 2014-2020, 83 percent of births
            worldwide were assisted by skilled health professionals, an increase 
            from 71 percent in the period from 2007 to 2013. The  COVID-19 pandemic 
            may reverse gains in skilled childbirth care coverage and disrupt
            maternity health services.<br/>The worls has made substantial
        progress towards the goal of ending preventable child deaths, with
    the global under-5 mortality rate decreasing from 76 to 38 deaths 
 per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2019.</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>The global neonatal mortality rate fell from 30 deaths to 17 per 1,000
                live births in the same period. Even with such progress, 5.2 million children
                died in 2019 before reaching their fifth birthday, with almost half of those deaths,
                2.4 million, occuring in the first month of life.
