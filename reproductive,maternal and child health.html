        <h2><i>Reproductive, Maternal and Child Health</i></h2>
        <p><h3>According to data from the period 2014-2020, 83 percent of births
            worldwide were assisted by skilled health professionals, an increase 
            from 71 percent in the period from 2007 to 2013. The  COVID-19 pandemic 
            may reverse gains in skilled childbirth care coverage and disrupt
            maternity health services.<br/>
            <ul><li>The world has made substantial
        progress towards the goal of ending preventable child deaths, with
    the global under-5 mortality rate decreasing from 76 to 38 deaths 
 per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2019.</li>
<li>The global neonatal mortality rate fell from 30 deaths to 17 per 1,000
    live births in the same period.</li>
    <li>Even with such progress, 5.2 million children
        died in 2019 before reaching their fifth birthday, with almost half of those deaths,
        2.4 million, occuring in the first month of life.</li>
        <li>While the full impact of the pandemic on child survival is not yet known, significant disruption to
            the continued provision of life-saving interventions could stall or even reverse the progress made.
        </li>
</ul></h3>
        </p><h3>
        The proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) who have their family planning needs met by modern 
        contraceptive metods has remained steady at around 77 percent between 2015 and 2021, reaching only 56 percent
        in sub-Saharan Africa and 52 percent in Oceania, excluding Australia and New Zeland.
    <br/>
    The ongoing pandemic may lead to reductions in these figures as a result of supply-chain disruptions and decreased 
    access to family planning services, while the fertility intentions and family planning needs among women of reproductive
    age may also change.

            <h3>
                The adolescent birth rate has fallen from 56 births per 1000 adolescent women 15 to 19 years of age
                in 2000 to 45 births per 1000 adolescents in 2015 and 41 per 1000 in 2020. The declines varied considerably
                across regions, with the largest decrease in central and Southern Asia from 70 births per 1000 adolescents
                in 2000 to 24 births per 1000 in 2020.
