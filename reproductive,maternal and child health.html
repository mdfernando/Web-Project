        <h2>Reproductive, Maternal and Child Health</h2>
        <p><h3>According to data from the period 2014-2020, 83 percent of births
            worldwide were assisted by skilled health professionals, an increase 
            from 71 percent in the period from 2007 to 2013. The  COVID-19 pandemic 
            may reverse gains in skilled childbirth care coverage and disrupt
            maternity health services.</h3>
